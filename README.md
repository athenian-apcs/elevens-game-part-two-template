# Week 1 Day 2: Elevens Game Part Two

In class today, you'll be writing some code to implement the rules for the Elevens Game. 

Instructions for the in-class work and the homework can be found on Canvas. 

<br />

Add code to [ElevensBoard.java](src/main/java/ElevensBoard.java), and then test your code by running the main method in [Main.java](src/main/java/Main.java) file. 

## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [Main.java](src/main/java/Main.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```

## Run your tests with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [MyTests.java](src/test/java/MyTests.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make test
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew test
```
